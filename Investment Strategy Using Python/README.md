# Investment Strategy Using Python

## Project Overview

This project examines a financial strategy where an individual invests a portion of their income over a fixed period to ensure financial sustainability after retirement. The analysis uses Python to simulate the impact of investing 50% of an individual’s income over a 10-year period, with a focus on validating the principle: "If you invest 50% of your income for 10 years, you will be able to support yourself."

## Aim & Purpose

The primary aim of this project is to evaluate whether investing 50% of annual income over 10 years will provide sufficient financial support for an individual upon retirement. The project explores the following objectives:

- Calculate and project yearly income, expenses, investments, and returns over a 20-year period.
- Validate if investing 50% of income with a fixed interest rate (8%) will sustain the individual financially after 10 years.
- Assess how varying income levels, investment proportions, and interest rates affect the financial outcome.

## Features

- **Income and Expense Modeling**: Simulate annual income and expenses, assuming a fixed expense rate of 50% of income.
- **Investment Calculation**: Compute annual investments by saving 50% of income, with returns calculated at an 8% annual interest rate.
- **Financial Projections**: Forecast yearly investments and returns for up to 20 years to evaluate long-term financial sustainability.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Analyze different scenarios by adjusting income, investment proportion, and interest rate to understand their impact on financial outcomes.

## What Are We Trying to Achieve?

The project aims to address several key questions:
- Can investing 50% of an individual’s income for 10 years ensure financial stability by retirement?
- How do different parameters (income, investment proportion, interest rate) impact the ability to sustain oneself financially in retirement?
- By 2033, will the accumulated investments be sufficient to cover living expenses and maintain financial security?

## Outcomes & Results

The project provides several key outcomes:
- **Financial Projections**: Detailed calculation and visualization of yearly income, expenses, investments, and returns.
- **Investment Feasibility**: Assessment of whether the investment strategy will be sufficient to support the individual financially by 2033.
- **Scenario Insights**: Insights into how changing parameters affect financial sustainability and strategy effectiveness.

## Findings

- **Investment Viability**: The analysis demonstrates that, with the given parameters, investing 50% of income allows the individual to sustain themselves financially by 2033.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Variations in income, investment proportion, and interest rates have significant effects on the financial outcome and sustainability.
- **Strategic Insights**: Provides a framework for adjusting investment strategies and understanding their long-term impact on financial security.

## Data Source

The calculations and projections are based on fixed parameters including a base annual income of $35,000, an interest rate of 8%, and a savings rate of 50%. The results are intended to provide a practical evaluation of the investment strategy’s effectiveness.
